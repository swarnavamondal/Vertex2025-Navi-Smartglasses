Description
This project aims to help visually impaired individuals by using AI-powered smart glasses that detect objects in front of them and provide real-time audio feedback. It integrates:

YOLOv8 for object detection
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for converting detected objects into speech
OpenCV for processing live video feed
Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano / ESP32 (optional for hardware implementation)

Features
‚úÖ Real-time object detection using YOLOv8
‚úÖ Text-to-Speech conversion to describe detected objects
‚úÖ Lightweight & fast processing for wearable smart glasses
‚úÖ Python-based solution for easy deployment

Technologies & Libraries Used
Python üêç
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for object detection
OpenCV for image processing
gTTS for text-to-speech conversion
playsound for playing the generated speech
Torch (for AI model inference)
